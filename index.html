<h2>Investments</h2>
<p>I currently invest at <a href="https://salmiraif.com/">Salmira</a>. We are opportunistic investors with flexibility in asset classes, stages, and capital structures. Contact me for detail and track record.</p>

<h2>Consulting</h2>
<p>I have advised on an ad hoc basis on various projects. My recent work has primarily been in investment due diligence, education technology, and start-up fundraising / strategy. 
  As a management consultant at Bain & Company, I also worked in software and healthcare strategy. 
  I am currently working full-time as an investor, but always happy to connect with the potential to work together in other ways, or to recommend friends who do similar consulting work.
